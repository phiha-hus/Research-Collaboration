Several approaches have been introduced in order to stabilize the integration process.
For an overview see [25, 51, 82, 164]. In principle, the regularization techniques
can be classied into three dierent categories.
The rst class are the stabilization methods, e.g., Baumgarte stabilization [19], the
use of singularly perturbed problems [82, 97], or lowering the index by dierentiation
of the constraints [66]. The second class covers the state space methods, e.g.,
[127, 139]. The third class is concerned with projection methods, e.g., the Gear-
Gupta-Leimkuhler formulation [68], overdetermined or ssf-formulation [60].
