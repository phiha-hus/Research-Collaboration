New def of shift index - suggested by Prof Linh

Definition 3 Suppose that the descriptor system (1.1) satisfies Assumption 5.
The minimum number \ell such that by using elementary matrix's row operations,
a strangeness-free descriptor system of the form (3.5) can be extracted from (4.1) (the inflated system of order 2 \ell)
is called the shift-index of (1.1), and be denoted by \nu.
