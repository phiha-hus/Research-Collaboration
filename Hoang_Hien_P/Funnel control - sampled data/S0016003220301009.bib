abstract = "In this paper, the problem of sampled-data stabilization for a class of nonlinear differential-algebraic systems is considered by using partial-state and output feedback. First, based on the output feedback domination approach, a systematic design procedure for sampled-data output feedback controller is proposed without using the states of the algebraic subsystem. It is shown that the proposed sampled-data controller can ensure the whole closed-loop nonlinear differential-algebraic system is asymptotically stable by choosing appropriate scaling gains and sampling period. In addition, due to the domination nature of the proposed method, the obtained results can be extended to more general class of nonlinear differential-algebraic systems easily. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method."
