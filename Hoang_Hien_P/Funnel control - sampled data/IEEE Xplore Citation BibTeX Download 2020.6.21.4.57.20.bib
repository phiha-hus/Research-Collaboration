  abstract={For nonlinear differential-algebraic equations system which satisfies linear growth condition and is of index one, this paper shows that there exists an appropriate sampling period such that the problem of sampled-data output feedback stabilization control can be solved. A linear explicit non-initialized observer is proposed, which means that the initial states of the observer are not necessarily restricted to the algebraic equations and the nonlinear terms of the controlled system are not needed to be known exactly. Then by feedbacking the state estimates, a linear sampled-data controller is designed, through which the whole closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable.},
