  abstract = {The solvability and stability analyses of linear time invariant systems of delay differential-algebraic equations (DDAEs) are analyzed. The behavior approach is applied to DDAEs in order to establish characterizations of their solvability in terms of spectral conditions. Furthermore, examples are delivered to demonstrate that the eigenvalue-based approach in analyzing the exponential stability of dynamical systems is only valid for a special class of DDAEs, namely, non-advanced. Then, a new concept of weak stability is proposed and studied for DDAEs whose matrix coefficients pairwise commute.},

The control law is of pole-placement type and based on input/output measurements and parametrical estimation only. The parametrical estimation algorithm incorporates adaptation dead zones to prevent against potential instability caused by disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. The Weierstrass canonical form is investigated in detail concerning the properties of controllability and observability via testable conditions of the given arbitrary state-space realization of the same order. Robust closed-loop stability is proved under similar conditions to those used for (nonsingular) standard systems.},

By using orthogonal changes of variables, the original DAE system is transformed into appropriate condensed forms, for which concepts such as Lyapunov exponents, Bohl exponents, exponential dichotomy and spectral intervals of various kinds can be analyzed via the resulting underlying ODE. Some essential differences between the spectral theory for ODEs and that for DAEs are pointed out. It is also discussed how numerical methods for computing the spectral intervals associated with Lyapunov and Sacker-Sell (exponential dichotomy) can be extended from those methods proposed for ODEs. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted to the analysis of linear second order discrete-time descriptor systems (or singular difference equations (SiDEs) with control). Following the algebraic approach proposed by Kunkel and Mehrmann for pencils of matrix valued functions, first we present a theoretical framework based on a procedure of reduction to analyze solvability of initial value problems for SiDEs, which is followed by the analysis of descriptor systems. We also describe methods to analyze structural properties related to the solvability analysis of these systems. Namely, two numerical algorithms for reduction to the so-called strangeness-free forms are presented. Two associated index notions are also introduced and discussed. This work extends and complements some recent results for high order continuous-time descriptor systems and first order discrete-time descriptor systems.},
