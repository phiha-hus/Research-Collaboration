  Abstract                 = {A linear ordinary differential operator of first order with bounded coefficients is shown to be invertible in L2n(−∞,∞) or Fredholm in L2n(0,∞) if and only if the underlying system of homogeneous differential equations has a dichotomy. In that case the operator is proved to be a direct sum of two generators of C0-semigroups, one of which has support on the negative half line and the other on the positive half line.},

For these systems we introduce a uniform differential time index and a differential space index. We show that in contrast to problems with regular matrices A and B the initial conditions and/or boundary conditions for problems with singular matrices A and B have to fulfill certain consistency conditions. Furthermore, two numerical methods for solving PDAEs are considered. In two theorems it is shown that there is a strong dependence of the order of convergence on these indexes. We present examples for the calculation of the order of convergence and give results of numerical calculations for several aspects encountered in the numerical solution of PDAEs.},

The aim is to give L2-convergence results for the semidiscretized systems when the finite element mesh parameter h goes to zero. In general, without the assumption of symmetry (and some further conditions) it is difficult to get such results. According to many practical applications, the PDAEs may have also hyperbolic parts.

A mathematical modelling typically yields systems of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). A multivariate signal model transforms the DAEs into multirate partial differential algebraic equations (MPDAEs). In the case of frequency modulation, an additional condition is required to identify an appropriate solution. We consider a necessary condition for an optimal solution and a phase condition. A method of lines, which discretises the MPDAEs as well as the additional condition, generates a larger system of DAEs. We analyse the differentiation index of this approximate DAE system, where the original DAEs are assumed to be semi-explicit systems. The index depends on the inclusion of either differential variables or algebraic variables in the additional condition.

The boundary conditions of these systems are governed by time-dependent differential–algebraic equations (DAEs) that couple the PDAE system with the network elements that are modelled by DAEs in time only. As the numerical difficulties for a DAE can be classified by the index concept, it seems to be natural to generalize these ideas to the PDAE case. There already exist some approaches for parabolic and hyperbolic equations. Here, we will focus on a new kind of index, the characteristics index for hyperbolic equations, that does not depend on the elimination of one of the independent variables. It relies on the fact that hyperbolic PDEs can be regarded as ODEs along the characteristics.},

Such a nonlinear perturbation arises in many applications through the usual cut-off procedure, but the requirement in the existing literature that the nonlinear perturbation is globally Ck-smooth and has a globally small Lipschitz constant is hardly met in those systems for which the phase space does not allow a smooth cut-off function. Our general results are illustrated by and applied to partial functional differential equations for which the phase space C([−r,0],X) (where r>0 and X being a Banach space) has no smooth inner product structure and for which the validity of variation-of-constants formula is still an interesting open problem."

  Abstract                 = {Multidegree of freedom nonlinear differential equations can often be transformed by means of the method of averaging into equivalent systems with only high-order terms. Under appropriate small-order perturbation conditions these systems have unique surfaces of solutions called integral manifolds. They generalize the notions of periodic and almost periodic solutions for single degree of freedom systems. In parametric form the integral manifolds satisfy a certain system of partial differential equations. Conversely, an Nth-order asymptotic integral manifold is defined as a formal solution of that system of partial differential equations, up to order N in the perturbation parameter. In the main result a system of integral equations is written for the remainder terms. By a contraction argument the system of integral equations has a fixed point, which, added to the Nth-order asymptotic integral manifold, forms an integral manifold for the normal system. By uniqueness this is the integral manifold sought. This implies that the unique integral manifold can be written as a formal series plus high order error terms. As an example a second order asymptotic representation for the periodic solution of a van der Pol oscillator is then developed.},

  Abstract                 = {Lyapunov and exponential dichotomy spectral theory is extended from ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to nonautonomous differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). By using orthogonal changes of variables, the original DAE system is transformed into appropriate condensed forms, for which concepts such as Lyapunov exponents, Bohl exponents, exponential dichotomy and spectral intervals of various kinds can be analyzed via the resulting underlying ODE. Some essential differences between the spectral theory for ODEs and that for DAEs are pointed out. It is also discussed how numerical methods for computing the spectral intervals associated with Lyapunov and Sacker-Sell (exponential dichotomy) can be extended from those methods proposed for ODEs. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

In any case the spectral intervals are associated with spectral manifolds comprising solutions with a common exponential growth rate.

  abstract = {We prove that the admissibility of any pair of vector-valued Schäffer function spaces (satisfying a very general technical condition) implies the existence of a “no past” exponential dichotomy for an exponentially bounded, strongly continuous cocycle (over a semiflow). Roughly speaking the class of Schäffer function spaces consists in all function spaces which are invariant under the right-shift and therefore our approach addresses most of the possible pairs of admissible spaces. Complete characterizations for the exponential dichotomy of cocycles are also obtained. Moreover, we involve a concept of a “no past” exponential dichotomy for cocycles weaker than the classical concept defined by Sacker and Sell (1994) in [23]. Our definition of exponential dichotomy follows partially the definition given by Chow and Leiva (1996) in [4] in the sense that we allow the unstable subspace to have infinite dimension. The main difference is that we do not assume a priori that the cocycle is invertible on the unstable space (actually we do not even assume that the unstable space is invariant under the cocycle). Thus we generalize some known results due to O. Perron (1930) [14], J. Daleckij and M. Krein (1974) [7], J.L. Massera and J.J. Schäffer (1966) [11], N. van Minh, F. Räbiger and R.

For an assessment of both of these aspects an important theoretical framework is the concept of index. In this contribution we propose a new method for a systematic index reduction of quasi-linear PDAE systems. The general idea is to reveal quasi-linear combinations of the differential quantities in the high-index model which are invariant with respect to a specific independent variable. By using these quasi-linear combinations as templates for symbolic manipulations, additional algebraic constraints become explicit. These explicit constraints are then used for index reduction yielding low-index PDAE models. The procedure is demonstrated in the context of a typical modeling work-flow for modeling problems of a tubular reactor, diffusive charge transport in electrolyte mixtures and incompressible fluid flow.},
