DAEs are nowadays pervasive in nonlinear circuit
analysis and design, specially because of their appearance in nodal analysis
methods used to set up network equations in circuit simulation programs
[85, 87, 112–116, 194, 253, 292, 293]. The reader is referred to Chapters
5 and 6 for extensive discussions of the role of DAEs in circuit modeling.

Regarding periodic DAEs and periodic
solutions, several results concerning Floquet theory for DAEs can be
found in [158, 159]; related aspects involving the analysis of nonlinear oscillations
in semistate models of electrical circuits are addressed in [74].

Qualitative features of nonlinear electrical circuits are often addressed via
state models; see [60, 64, 65, 88, 103–105, 128, 201, 204, 286, 287] and
references therein. Many results involving equilibria were established via
state space formulations in the 1970s; a compilation of these results can be
found in the survey paper [60]. As it happens in index analyses, qualitative
properties of equilibria can be assessed in terms of the topology of the
circuit and the electrical features of the devices. Topological aspects were
already emphasized in [60, 64, 65].
