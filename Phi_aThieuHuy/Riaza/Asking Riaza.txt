Dear Prof. Riaza,



my name is Phi Ha. I am a former PhD student by Volker Mehrmann and former Postdoc by Caren Tischendorf. 
Recently I am working with the hyperbolicity and exponential dichotomy of DAEs, and I have one problem, which really bothers me. 
So I would be very grateful if you could provide some help or suggestions. 



My problem is that, there are very very few example about hyperbolicity of index 1 DAEs (in the sense that there exist eigenvalues with both positive and negative real part. This leads to exponential dichotomy). 
My only example, till now, comes from your article

A matrix pencil approach to the local stability analysis of non-linear circuits, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUIT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS,
Int. J. Circ. Theor. Appl. 2004; 32:23–46

which is Example 4.1 about the Josephson junction. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you could suggest some other examples for hyperbolicity. 
By the way, I still wonder (may be quite solly) whether hyperbolicity could occur in case that the electrical network contains only Resistor, Inductor and Capacitor. 
How do you think about this?

Thank you very much in advanced,

With best regards,
Phi Ha.
