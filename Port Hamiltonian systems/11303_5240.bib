   abstract = {The question when a general linear time invariant control system is equivalent to a port-Hamiltonian systems is answered. Several equivalent characterizations are derived which extend the characterizations of [38] to the general non-minimal case. An explicit
construction of the transformation matrices is presented. The methods are applied in the stability analysis of disc brake squeal.}
