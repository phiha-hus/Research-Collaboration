About contractivity of  fractional DDE

1. retarded type - very new results 2019. No convergence rate estimation.
2. Neutral - maybe due to step-by-step estimation, so it is too difficult to give an estimation


Why not contractivity of Fractional DAE :

1. contractivity of DAEs see Thesis of Menrah, book by Lamour-Mars-Tischendorf.
2. contractivity of Fractional ODEs, where?
