abstract = {Abstract This paper is concerned with the problem of reachable set estimation for discrete-time singular systems with bounded input disturbances. Based on the Lyapunov method, a new sufficient condition is established in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) to guarantee that the reachable set of discrete-time singular system is bounded by the intersection of ellipsoids. Then the result is extended to the problem for discrete-time singular systems with time-varying delay by utilizing the delay-dependent approach and free weighting matrices. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results proposed in this paper.},
