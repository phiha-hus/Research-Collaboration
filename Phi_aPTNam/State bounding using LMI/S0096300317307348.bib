abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of reachable set estimation for a class of uncertain singular systems with time-varying delays from a new point of view. Our consideration is centered on the design of a proportional-derivative state feedback controller (PDSFC) such that the considered singular system is robustly normalizable and all the states of the closed-loop system can be contained by a bounded set under zero initial conditions. First, a nominal singular time-delay system is considered and sufficient conditions are obtained in terms of matrix inequalities for the existence of a PDSFC and an ellipsoid. In this case, the considered system is guaranteed to be normalizable and the reachable set of the closed-loop systems is contained by the ellipsoid. Then, the result is extended to the case of singular time-delay systems with polytopic uncertainties and relaxed conditions are derived by introducing some weighting matrix variables. Furthermore, based on the obtained results, the reachable set of the considered closed-loop singular system can be contained in a prescribed ellipsoid. Finally, the effectiveness of our results are demonstrated by two numerical examples.}
