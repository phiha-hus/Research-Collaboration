abstract = {In this paper, the problem of reachable set estimation of singular systems is investigated. Based on the Lyapunov method, a sufficient condition is established in terms of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) to guarantee that the reachable set of singular system is bounded by the intersection of ellipsoids. Then the result is extended to the problem for singular systems with time-varying delay by utilizing the reciprocally convex approach. The effectiveness of the obtained results in this paper is illustrated by numerical examples.}
