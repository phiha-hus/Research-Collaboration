1. When does a delayed-pH DAEs is positive and stable.


2. Non-delayed pH-DAE is nice ( Ctrb <=> Obsv )
But not stability, since it has index >= 2 (typically).
Conditions exist for linear homogenous systems, Ait-Rami,Virnik,Hannes'21


Not all pH-DAE is stable (not really, since the algebaric part = 0), but stable pH-DAEs can be obtained from stable descriptor system
using equivalent system transformation, making use of the solution to a matrix - Lyapunov equation.

pH-Realization problem for positive and stable descriptor system with/without time-delays.

3. Trick S+N = XY does not work since it destroys the structure of pH. => must work with positive system with D. 


Passive pH is always stabilizable ==> Is it bad?



For DAEs, no high index positivity has been considered?
