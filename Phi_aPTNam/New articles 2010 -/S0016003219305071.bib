abstract = {A new method is proposed to analyze stability of descriptor systems with multiple commensurate time-delays. In this method, purely imaginary roots of the system are calculated, asymptotic behavior of root path at these roots is studied, and unstable regions of the system in the space of delays are determined. Moreover, the number of roots in each unstable region is calculated. Also necessary and sufficient conditions for τ-stabilizability of these systems are presented. Examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.}
