abstract = {This article mainly studies the problem of the exponential stability for singular systems with two interval time-varying delays. By constructing a modified Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and utilising a convex polyhedron method to estimate the derivative of LKF, some new delay-dependent criteria can be established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Compared with some existing literatures, the novelties in this study are that the needed decisive variables are fewer and the obtained delay-dependent stability criteria are less conservative. Finally, two illustrative numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the derived results.},
