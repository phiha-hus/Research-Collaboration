abstract = {This paper deals with the class of continuous-time singular linear systems with multiple time-varying delays in a range. The global exponential stability problem of this class of systems is addressed. Delay-range-dependent sufficient conditions such that the system is regular, impulse-free and α-stable are developed in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) setting. Moreover, an estimate of the convergence rate of such stable systems is presented. A numerical example is employed to show the usefulness of the proposed results.}
