  abstract={This technical note is concerned with positivity characteristic of continuous-time descriptor systems with time delays. First, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions is presented to check the property. Then, considering a descriptor time-delay system with two assumptions, a new time-delay system is established whose positivity is equivalent to that of the original system. Furthermore, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions is provided to check the positivity of the new system. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the validity of the results obtained.},
